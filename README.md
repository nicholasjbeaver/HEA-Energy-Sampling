# HEA-Energy-Sampling
A method to randomly sample the atomic configuration space of cubic High-Entropy Alloys using ALIGNN-FF (energy)

This repository contains the code and data for the paper <em> Rapid Assessment of Stable Crystal Structures in Single Phase High Entropy Alloys Via Graph Neural Network Based Surrogate Modelling </em> <https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07664>

There is a python notebook that contains all of the functionality - it was created in Google Colab, so that is reccomended for use of the code. The model uses GPUs (if available) and a fair bit of RAM depending on the parameters used.
